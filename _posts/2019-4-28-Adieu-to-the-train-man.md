March was a month of mixed emotions as many of us graduated to newer semesters
and greater challenges, while also having to bid farewell to some of our dear
friends who would graduate from the University.

One such close friend is N.R.L. Suresh, who also happened to be our former Vice
President. ISAT presented him with a gala farewell with a 食べ放題 (meaning
all-you-can-eat in Japanese) at one of the most authentic Indian restaurants
in Tokyo, Nirvanam.

Here's presenting you with some memorable photos from the event.
